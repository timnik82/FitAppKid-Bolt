## 🎨 Design & Accessibility Decisions

### **Language Implementation**
- **Chosen**: Russian-only interface for simplicity
- **Database**: Utilizes existing `name_ru` fields from database
- **Fallback**: English (`name_en`) when Russian not available

### **Mobile-First Design**
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ≥44px
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile: 320px+
  - Tablet: 768px+ (primary target)
  - Desktop: 1024px+

### **Color Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**
- **Categories**: 
  - Разминка (Warm-up): #F97316 (orange)
  - Основная часть (Main): #3B82F6 (blue)
  - Заминка (Cool-down): #10B981 (green)
  - Осанка (Posture): #8B5CF6 (purple)
- **Difficulties**:
  - Легко (Easy): #10B981 (green)
  - Средне (Medium): #F59E0B (amber)
  - Сложно (Hard): #EF4444 (red)

src/components/
├── ExerciseCatalog.tsx      # Main catalog container
├── ExerciseCard.tsx         # Individual exercise display
├── FilterBar.tsx            # Filtering interface
├── auth/                    # Authentication components
