## 🎨 Design & Accessibility Decisions

### **Language Implementation**
- **Chosen**: Russian-only interface for simplicity
- **Database**: Utilizes existing `name_ru` fields from database
- **Fallback**: English (`name_en`) when Russian not available

### **Mobile-First Design**
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ≥44px
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile: 320px+
  - Tablet: 768px+ (primary target)
  - Desktop: 1024px+

### **Color Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**
- **Categories**: 
  - Разминка (Warm-up): #F97316 (orange)
  - Основная часть (Main): #3B82F6 (blue)
  - Заминка (Cool-down): #10B981 (green)
  - Осанка (Posture): #8B5CF6 (purple)
- **Difficulties**:
  - Легко (Easy): #10B981 (green)
  - Средне (Medium): #F59E0B (amber)
  - Сложно (Hard): #EF4444 (red)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Component Structure**
```
src/components/
├── ExerciseCatalog.tsx      # Main catalog container
├── ExerciseCard.tsx         # Individual exercise display
├── FilterBar.tsx            # Filtering interface
├── auth/                    # Authentication components
├── dashboard/               # Parent dashboard
│   ├── ParentDashboard.tsx  # Main parent interface
│   └── AddChildModal.tsx    # Child management
└── [other existing components]
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Parent Login** → Dashboard with children list
2. **Child Selection** → Exercise catalog for selected child
3. **Exercise Filtering** → Real-time database queries
4. **Exercise Selection** → (Future: Exercise execution flow)

### **Database Integration**
- **Real-time Queries**: Supabase with proper error handling
- **Filtering Logic**: Server-side filtering for performance
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all data

---

## 🚧 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### **Resolved Issues ✅**
- ✅ ESLint errors fixed: 42 issues reduced to 1 harmless warning
- ✅ TypeScript `any` types replaced with proper interfaces
- ✅ Bundle size optimized: 569KB → 489KB main bundle with code splitting
- ✅ React Hook dependencies resolved with useCallback patterns

### **Remaining Minor Issues**
- ⚠️ React fast refresh warning in AuthContext (non-blocking)
- ⚠️ Development server network binding issues on macOS (config-related)

### **Performance Optimizations Completed**
- ✅ **Bundle Splitting**: Separate chunks for dashboard (46KB) and catalog (48KB)
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand with Suspense
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance for adventure system

### **Future Performance Enhancements**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large exercise lists (if needed)
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks
- **Service Worker**: Offline access support
- **Caching**: Advanced exercise data caching
